### **Pizza Sales SQL Project**

#### **Introduction**
üçï Welcome to the world of pizza data! This project dives deep into a comprehensive pizza sales dataset to uncover key insights about customer preferences, high-demand items, peak sales times, and revenue generation. 

üíª Using SQL queries, I analyzed critical data points to identify top-selling pizzas, revenue trends, and demand patterns for each pizza category.

üìä **SQL Queries**: The complete set of SQL queries for this project can be found in the **project_sql** folder.

#### **Background**
This project was initiated to understand the key drivers in pizza sales, providing insights that could enhance restaurant management and marketing strategies. From identifying the highest revenue-generating pizzas to spotting popular order times, this analysis aims to streamline business decisions around inventory, staffing, and promotional activities.

The dataset includes information on order details, pizza types, and pricing, making it a rich resource for discovering actionable patterns and customer preferences in the pizza market.

### **Analysis Questions**
The main questions explored through SQL queries in this project were:

1. **Total Orders and Revenue**: What is the total number of orders placed? What is the total revenue generated from pizza sales?
2. **Popular Items and Pricing**: Which is the highest-priced pizza, and what is the most commonly ordered pizza size? 
3. **Top-Selling Pizzas**: What are the top 5 most ordered pizza types?
4. **Category and Demand Patterns**: How is the demand distributed across pizza categories and times of the day?
5. **Revenue Analysis**: Which pizzas contribute the most to revenue, and how does revenue accumulate over time?

### **Tools Used**
For efficient data analysis and visualization, I leveraged the following tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of this analysis, SQL was used for data extraction and transformation.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database management system used to store and query the pizza sales data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My development environment for writing and testing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and sharing my SQL scripts, enabling collaborative improvements.

### **The Analysis**

Each query provided insights into different aspects of the pizza sales data:

#### **Basic Analysis**
1. **Total Orders and Revenue**  
   Query: This query retrieves the total number of orders placed and calculates total revenue from pizza sales.

2. **Highest Priced Pizza and Most Common Pizza Size**  
   Query: Identifies the highest-priced pizza on the menu and finds the most commonly ordered pizza size.

3. **Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types**  
   Query: Lists the top 5 most ordered pizza types, highlighting popular choices among customers.

#### **Intermediate Analysis**
1. **Total Quantity by Pizza Category**  
   Query: Joins tables to compute the total quantity ordered for each pizza category, offering insight into category-level demand.

2. **Order Distribution by Time of Day**  
   Query: Analyzes order timestamps to determine peak ordering times.

3. **Category-Wise Pizza Demand Distribution**  
   Query: Provides a category-based breakdown of pizza demand, highlighting preferences across pizza types.

4. **Average Daily Orders**  
   Query: Groups orders by date and calculates the average number of pizzas ordered daily, identifying sales trends over time.

5. **Top 3 Revenue-Generating Pizzas**  
   Query: Ranks the top 3 pizza types by revenue, highlighting the most profitable items.

#### **Advanced Analysis**
1. **Percentage Contribution to Total Revenue**  
   Query: Calculates each pizza type's percentage contribution to the total revenue to measure individual item significance.

2. **Cumulative Revenue Over Time**  
   Query: Tracks the accumulation of revenue over time, providing a visual of business growth.

3. **Top 3 Revenue-Generating Pizzas by Category**  
   Query: Identifies the top 3 pizzas in each category based on revenue, showcasing high-value items in each category.
